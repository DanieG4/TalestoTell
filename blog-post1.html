            <h1>Montenegros Golden Hour</h1>
            <p>
              Located on the southwerstern coast along the Adriatic sea, this stunning bay holds many stories from centuries
              of change. This bay has been a prime location for traders dating back over 2,500 years resulting in 
              many different countries taking it over as the years went on. The old town that connects to it feels like a 
              step back in time. The inding cobblestone pathways once led pirates and invaders astray as they tried to overtake.

                As we sat and watched this susnset one beautiful night in August, we got to talking to a local
                named Luka. A boisterious, friendly and very blunt Luka offered us some fresh cheese from his farm as we told
                him about America. He has lived in rural Montenegro all his life but works and brings his children to school in old town Kotor.
                Since he spends a good amount of time interacting with tourists, his English was fantastic.  We asked him about 
                his favorite legends surrounding the bay. As he cycled through the many in his head, one came to mind as his favorite- 
                the legend of our lady of the rocks.
