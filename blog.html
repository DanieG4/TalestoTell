                    There are some places so beautiful, its hard to believe that they exist
                    at the same time as you. The bay of Kotor is certainly one of them. I havent heard much about
                    Montenegro prior to my visit. It was certainly one of those trips where I was blown away by each
                    new piece of history I learned. Let me tell you about some of the legends of the bay.

                   Kamakura- a place beyond words. On my first trip to Japan, I knew I wanted to explore further then Tokyo
                   and the areas we were spending time skiing. However, Kamakura was one of those last minute decisions made
                   over a 7/11 makeshift dinner at our air bnb. We searched oll of those "must do" lists and strangely Kamakura only
                   came up once or twice. For a place with such a rich history, the lore lives on through its natural beauty.

                    Welcome to my "chasing the peak" series! Each week through the month of December I will come on here 
                    and tell you the ins and outs of some of my favorite mountains! As someone who spends just about all her 
                    time sking and working in the industry- here are my tales from the slopes! First up: Breckenridge Resort in Colorado.

                      This post is going to be a little different this time around. On my recent trip to Milos, Greece I was the lucky gal 
                      who was able to spend an entire day at a private beach....not one person in sight. My husband and I sat at this cove for 
                      HOURS creating our own stories of the magical ocean and rock features that were beautifully presented around us. Let me take
                      you through some of the thoughts we had on this truly special day.

                      Ahh yes the legendary question on all of my travels- "But what will you eat? How can you tell if something
                      has meat in it with the language barrier" The questions are endless from my friends and family with very limited dietary
                      restrictions. This question usually doesnt affect me too much, but for this first trip to Japan I did have moments of 
                      concern visitng such a culturally different place. As a foodie myself, im here to tell you the reality for us non meat eaters
                     in Tokyo.
