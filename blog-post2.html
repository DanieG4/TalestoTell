              <h1>Sipping Serenity in Kamakura</h1>
              <p>
                Kamakura is a small city just south of Tokyo. With massive historical significance Kamakura 
                marks the turn of the tides in Japan when the samurai class rose to power. Kamakura holds a mix of 
                historical landmarks, Buddhist temples and shrines and many scenic nature trails. I could truly go on 
                for days about all that was seen on my visit, but that will come in time. For today, I want to tell you 
                about the Tokeiji Temple- otherwise known as the Bamboo forest shrine. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Tokeiji Temple has a truly rich history, one that I feel proud to tell you about. It was founded in 1285
              but Hojo Masako during a time where women had very limited rights. Many women at the time were forced to stay in 
              unhappy, abusive and dangerous situations and marriages. This temple was built as a safe haven for these women to
              go to.
