            <p> Hello fellow wanderlust friends! </p>
                
               <p> I am New England native who
                moved to the rockies in search of adventure- and boy did I find it! I am an outdoor 
                enthusiest who thrives on each adventure and experience I am lucky enough to find. 
                Growing up, I was limited in where I could go but daydreamed of all the places I have yet to
                see. (yes I was that person dropping my google guy all over the world and standing
                in the travel section of barnes and noble for just a little too long)
                My inspiration for travel comes from a very vulnerable place. I learned from a very young
                age how short life is with the loss of many important people in my life. After feeling stuck
                for a lot of my life, I am finally able to fuel that wanderlust energy.
              </p> 


              <p>
                When Im not enjoying the stunning landscapes outside of my door, you can find me 
                plotting my next adventure. Whether I'm getting lost in a new city or trying to 
                communicate with locals in a language I barely know, I embrace every moment 
                (and every mishap!) that travel brings. 
              </p>
               
              <p>
                I cant wait to share my experiences with you all. All of the good and all of the real!
                I aim to show you the true sides of traveling through first hand stories and experiences. Thanks
                for joining!
            </p>
